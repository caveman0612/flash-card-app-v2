This Project allows for creating and editing decks of flashcards. The user can make mulitple decks and have many cards in each deck. They can go through and modify the decks and cards any time and delete if necessary. Lastly, there is a study feature that will only show you the front of one card at a time and you can study to see if you know the back.

## Going Forward

I would like to add a postgreSQL back end to this project to allow for some data permenance. Then I would switch the front end to vercel and have to back end on heroku to allow for better response time and a better user expierence.
